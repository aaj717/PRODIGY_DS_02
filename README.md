This is for Prodigy Infotech internship Task-02 (Data Science)
This project focuses on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and preparing features for analysis. EDA techniques were applied to explore relationships between variables such as age, gender, passenger class, and survival. Visualizations were used to identify key patterns and trends, providing insights into factors that influenced survival outcomes.
