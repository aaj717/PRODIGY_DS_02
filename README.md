# PRODIGY_DS_02
Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Task 2)

📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow on the Titanic dataset. The primary objective of this project is to clean and prepare the raw dataset, explore relationships between features, and identify meaningful patterns and trends that contribute to understanding survival outcomes.

📂 Dataset Source

The dataset used for this analysis is from the Prodigy InfoTech Task 2 repository: https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%202

📊 Insights & Key Findings

-Survival rates varied significantly by gender, with female passengers showing higher survival.

-Passengers in higher classes (Pclass 1) had better survival outcomes.

-Age influenced survival probability, with certain age groups having higher survival rates.

-Visualizations helped reveal important interactions between variables.

🧾 Conclusion

This EDA project illustrates the importance of data cleaning and exploratory analysis in understanding patterns and trends in real-world datasets. The insights from the Titanic dataset reveal how demographic and socioeconomic factors impacted survival outcomes, and highlight the value of visual storytelling in data science.
